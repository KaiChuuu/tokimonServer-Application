# Tokimon server/application

Created a Spring Boot server with REST Api to manage/store creatures called Tokimon's (Essentially Pokemon's). 

Also created a JavaFx application to access the server through HTTP protocols.

## What I learned

* How to run a Spring Boot server.

* How to use HTTP layer protocols to communicate with the web server. (PUT/POST, GET, DELETE)
