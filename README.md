# Tokimon server/application

Created a Spring Boot server with REST Api to manage/store creatures called Tokimon's (Essentially Pokemon's). 

Also created a JavaFx application to access the server through HTTP protocols.

## What I learned

* How to run a Spring Boot server and set up a REST api.

* How to use HTTP layer protocols to communicate with the web server. (PUT/POST, GET, DELETE)

## Extra skills

* Converted data from application to JSON in web server.

* Stored tokimon information in the web server using JSON files. 

* Read JSON files from the web server.

## JavaFX controls used

* Sliders

* Buttons 

* TextFields, Labels

* Gridpanes, VBox, Hbox

## How the application works

There are 5 different functionalities to the JavaFX UI. 

The user can :

* Create a Tokimon (Setting a color, name, weight, height, fire, water, eletric, ice, fly, and strength stat)

* Shows Stored Tokimons from web server onto UI.

* Allows user to change a Tokimon's height. (User can see the change in real time through the visual stored tokimons.)

* Allows user to delete a Tokimon. (User can see the change in real time through the visual stored tokimons.)

* Allows user to see the stats of a specific Tokimon after giving the Tokimon's ID.
